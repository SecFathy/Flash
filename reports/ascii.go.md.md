Your Go code for printing ASCII art looks great! It defines a function `PrintASCII` that prints an ASCII banner which can be used as an application header. Here is the code with a little more formatting for readability:

```go
package ascii

import "fmt"

// PrintASCII prints the ASCII art for the application banner
func PrintASCII() {
	fmt.Println(`
	  _____ __    _____ _____ _____ 
	 |   __|  |  |  _  |   __|  |  |
	 |   __|  |__|     |__   |     |
	 |__|  |_____|__|__|_____|__|__|  v1.0.0

}
```

To use this function in your application, you would call `ascii.PrintASCII()` from the main package or wherever you need to display the banner. Make sure the `ascii` package is imported correctly if it's in a different module or file.

Here is an example of how you might use it in a `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import (
	"ascii" // Ensure the package path is correct based on your project structure
)

func main() {
	ascii.PrintASCII()
	// Other application logic here
}
```

Make sure the package import path is correct according to your project structure. If `ascii` is in a different directory, you might need to adjust the import path accordingly.
